# Title
Emission Tracker
# Sustainable Development Goal(s)
Our group plans to focus our project on SDG 13, Climate Action. Possible contributions that our project could offer would be sharing information regarding Climate Action, such as tracking various types of emissions based on country.

# Features

## Feature 1:  
Look up top CO2 emission information about a specific country 

* Person responsible: Beyonce 
* User story:  As a user interested in climate change, I can look up individual countries' top Co2 emission so that I can form a more comprehensive view of the world.

* Acceptance Criteria: Given that I (the user) pick a country, I will receive an output of the highest co2 emission that is recorded.


## Feature 2: 
 Look up information about the average CO2 emission information of a country

* Person responsible:Bradley
* User story: As a user interested in climate change, I can find the average emissions of a country to have a better understanding of the impacts the country has had on the environment on average
* Acceptance Criteria: Given that a specific country is chosen, then we should calculate and output the average CO2 emissions of that country for all years in the data set.

## Feature 3:  
Look up CO2 emissions of all countries for a specific year

* Person responsible: Rimona
* User story: As a user interested in climate change, I want to compare CO2 emissions between each country in the dataset in a specific year so that I can learn more about how they compare to one another.
* Acceptance Criteria:

# Data story

Bradley found the CO2 emissions and Beyonce found the Electricity emissions. 

We are excited about this project because we aim to share a clear depiction of how climate change has progressed over the years, along with understanding how energy consumption has developed along with it.
